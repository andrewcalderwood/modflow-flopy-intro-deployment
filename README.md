## JupyterLite Requirements

JupyterLite is being tested against modern web browsers:

- Firefox 90+
- Chromium 89+

## MODFLOW Exercises 

The MODFLOW groundwater modeling exercises within are based on those from Hill and Tiedeman 2007. These are the same exercises with training completed in ModelMuse to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) experience. However, in this case the user will use pre-built jupyter notebooks to step through the code chunks to load data and write the various MODFLOW packages required to run a model. The goal is to provide an alternate approach for the user to develop MODFLOW models with tools, e.g., python and jupyter, that support the ready data analysis required to pre-process time series and spatial data.
